## Translations

If you want to translate one of these sheets, please download the related text file in the `i18n/` folder.
Just fill the file, and I’ll take care of the sheet generation, hosting and updates.

A few notes about translations:
- Texts are in the same order you’ll find them on the sheet, this will help you to get context
- Please only change the `transl` sections, without changing `origin`
- Pay close attention to respect punctuation, case and spaces (while adapting them for your language)
- Try to get translations with a length as close as possible from the original text
- Feel free to use inclusive/neutral language if you want, this is a small effort and will be warmly welcomed
- If they exist, please rely as much as possible on "official translations" provided by recognized organization

You can contact me by email or use a GitHub Pull Request to send me the translation. Keep in mind we may have to discuss some translations to get them to fit in such a restricted space.
